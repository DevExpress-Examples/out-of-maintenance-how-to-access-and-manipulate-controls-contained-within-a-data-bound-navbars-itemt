We continue to enhance DevExpress-related learning materials/examples on GitHub. Unfortunately, this example lacked user interest and its code base is now obsolete.

If the use-case outlined in this example is of importance to you (or if you require additional guidance), please submit a support ticket via the [DevExpress Support Center](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/create?followUpTo=E73). We will be happy to follow-up.
